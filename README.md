# Screenshot tool snippet


## C# screenshot tool snippet
The "screenshot tool snippet.cs" is for you to implement a screenshot tool (widget) that could be useful in multiple situations if you have to take screenshots as a daily activity at your job or maybe you need to continually share what you can see in your screen as part of technical support. 
The snippet privides the following features:

- One-click screenshots of primary or secondary screens.
- Show or hide taskbar.
- Optionally copy to clipboard automatically.
- Set different amounts of time in seconds or even miliseconds to wait before taking the screenshot.
- Change from primary to secondary screen in one click (the other way around too).

"Screenshot tool.exe" is a pre-built application with all those features and a few more.
